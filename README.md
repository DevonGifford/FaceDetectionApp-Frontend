# Face Detection App

## Created using class based components
Although modern React tends to use functional components, I wanted to expand my knowledge of class components as I beliee it's a useful skill to have in my toolbox.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App] - (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
