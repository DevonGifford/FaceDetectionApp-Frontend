# Face Detection App

## Created using class based components
Although modern React tends to use functional components, I wanted to expand my knowledge of class components as I beliee it's a useful skill to have in my toolbox.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App] - (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To run this app

1. Clone this repo
2. Run ### `npm install`
3. Run ### `npm start`
4. You must add your own API key in the src/App.js file to connect to Clarifai.

You can grab Clarifai API key [here](https://www.clarifai.com/)
